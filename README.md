Here is my homework. I've included screenshots, the script I used (wasn't sure which file type you wanted so I sent two), and my excel file. Other than that, I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to be writing here so let me know in the grading feedback if there is anything in particular that I should include in the README files going forward. Thanks,

Ian O'Connor
